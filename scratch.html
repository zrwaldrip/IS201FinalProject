    <br>
    <p class="paragraphstyle">The queen angelfish is one of the most vibrant and visually stunning species found in the
        Caribbean and Gulf of
        Mexico. Juveniles are brightly colored with electric blue, yellow, and black markings, including a prominent
        black spot near the dorsal fin. As they mature, their coloration becomes more regal, with deep blue and yellow
        hues and a characteristic crown-like pattern around their heads. Queen angelfish are primarily herbivores,
        feeding on algae, sponges, and small invertebrates, and they are often seen gliding gracefully through the coral
        reefs in pairs or small groups.</p>

    </h2>
    <img class="imgcenter" src="assets/QueenTrigger.jpeg" alt="Queen Triggerfish">
    <br>
    <p class="paragraphstyle">The queen triggerfish is a colorful, robust species found in the coral reefs of the
        Western Atlantic,
        particularly in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. Juveniles are vibrant, with blue and yellow hues and a
        characteristic black spot near the pectoral fin. As adults, they grow larger and develop more muted,
        greenish-blue tones with a prominent spine on their dorsal fin that can be locked into place for defense. Known
        for their territorial and aggressive behavior, adult queen triggerfish feed on crustaceans, mollusks, and other
        reef invertebrates, using their powerful jaws to break open hard shells.</p>

        Spotlight Parrotfish (Scarus genazonus)

    <img class="imgcenter" src="assets/StoplightParrot.jpeg" alt="Spotlight Parrotfish">
    <br>
    <p class="paragraphstyle">The spotlight parrotfish is a brightly colored reef fish found in the Caribbean and
        Western Atlantic. Juveniles
        are smaller, with pale blue or green hues and a distinctive dark spot near the body’s middle, giving them their
        name. As adults, they develop more vibrant shades of blue, green, and yellow, with the spot becoming more
        prominent. Parrotfish are herbivores, feeding on algae and coral, and play an essential role in reef health by
        controlling algal growth. Their strong, beak-like teeth allow them to scrape algae from coral surfaces,
        contributing to the dynamic ecology of coral reefs.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="paragraphstyle">The spotted drum is a striking, small fish found in the warm waters of the Caribbean and
        Gulf of Mexico.
        Juveniles are especially eye-catching, with a pale body marked by bold black spots and a long, flowing dorsal
        fin that gives them a "drum-like" appearance. As adults, the black spots become less prominent, but their
        characteristic long fins remain. Spotted drums are often found in sandy or rocky reef habitats, where they feed
        on small invertebrates. Their rhythmic fin movements are thought to be a form of communication or a display,
        adding to their unique charm.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="paragraphstyle">The French angelfish is a striking reef fish found in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic.
        Juveniles are marked by
        vibrant black and yellow vertical stripes, which help them blend into their coral reef habitat. As they mature,
        their coloration deepens, and they take on a darker blue-black hue with gold accents, especially around the
        edges of their fins and around their eyes. French angelfish are omnivores, feeding on sponges, algae, and other
        reef invertebrates. They are often seen in pairs, gliding gracefully through the coral reefs of their tropical
        environments.</p>

    </h2>
    <img class="imgcenter" src="assets/GreenMoray.jpeg" alt="Green Moray Eel">
    <br>
    <p class="paragraphstyle">The green moray eel is a large, distinctive eel found in the Atlantic and Caribbean, often
        in caves and crevices
        on coral reefs. Although its name suggests a green color, its body is actually a yellowish-green hue, which
        becomes more pronounced as the eel matures. Juveniles are smaller and more slender, with a paler body color.
        Adult green moray eels are known for their powerful jaws and voracious appetite, feeding on fish, crustaceans,
        and mollusks. Despite their intimidating appearance, they are generally shy and spend much of their time hidden
        in reef crevices.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="paragraphstyle">The Moorish idol is a highly distinctive and elegant fish found in the Indo-Pacific,
        particularly around coral
        reefs. Recognizable by its long, ribbon-like dorsal fin and bold black, white, and yellow vertical stripes, the
        Moorish idol is often considered one of the most beautiful fish in the ocean. While juveniles may have more
        muted colors, adults display a brilliant contrast between black, yellow, and white. These fish primarily feed on
        sponges and small invertebrates and are often seen in pairs or small groups in coral reef environments, where
        they contribute to the balance of the reef ecosystem.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="paragraphstyle">The yellowtail damselfish is a vibrant and aggressive species found in the coral reefs of
        the Indo-Pacific.
        Juveniles have a striking bright yellow tail and a dark blue body, which provides excellent camouflage among the
        reef’s structure. As adults, they maintain their bright yellow tail but become larger and more territorial,
        defending their patch of the reef from other fish. These small but feisty fish primarily feed on algae, and
        their aggressive behavior makes them a dominant presence in their habitat, where they play an important role in
        maintaining the balance of reef ecosystems.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="paragraphstyle">The longnose butterflyfish is a graceful and distinctive species found in the coral reefs
        of the Indo-Pacific.
        Known for its elongated, needle-like snout, the longnose butterflyfish has a body that is typically yellow with
        black markings. These fish are often seen darting around coral reefs, where they feed on small invertebrates and
        coral polyps. Their long snout allows them to feed on hard-to-reach crevices in the coral, and their striking
        appearance makes them a favorite among divers and snorkelers. They are generally solitary or found in small
        groups.</p>

    <p class="paragraphstyle">The threadfin butterflyfish is a beautiful species native to the Indo-Pacific, recognized
        for its long, trailing
        fins and striking yellow and white coloration. They are commonly found around coral reefs, where they feed on
        coral polyps and small invertebrates. Juveniles are often more vibrant with intense colors, while adults tend to
        develop slightly more muted tones. Threadfin butterflyfish are often seen in pairs and are known for their
        graceful swimming patterns as they move through the reef, contributing to the diversity and health of their
        ecosystem.</p>
